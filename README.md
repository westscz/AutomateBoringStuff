# AutomateBoringStuff

Here is more detailed information about scripts I have written. 
I create these little programs as experiments to play with the language, or to solve problems for myself. 

- [chrome_pocket.py](chrome_pocket.py) - Get saved articles from pocket and move them to folder in chrome bookmarks
- [find_rss_feed.py](find_rss_feed.py) - For RSS_URLS_list find RSS urls and generate opml.xml file
- [instagram_saved.py](instagram_saved.py) - Download all saved photos from instagram account
- [xboxunity_util.py](archive/xboxunity_util.py) - Move directories with xboxunity ID to directory with game name
- [xiaomi_files.py](archive/xiaomi_files.py) - Change names from xiaomi photoalbum to `y-m-d h.m.s` format

Warning: No guarantee that any of this stuff works.
