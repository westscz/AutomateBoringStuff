# Lists!

In python you can make trully awesome things!
For example, we can create empty list
"""
l = []
"""
After that we can add new things to list.
If list is empty, python threats it as False value
<!--s-->
"""
assert not l
"""
Lets add some things to list!
"""
l.append(1)
l.append(2)
assert len(l) == 2
"""
