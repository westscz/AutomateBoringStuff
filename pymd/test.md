# Lists!



In python you can make trully awesome things!

For example, we can create empty list

```python
l = []

```
After that we can add new things to list.

If list is empty, python threats it as False value

<!--s-->

```python
assert not l

```
Lets add some things to list!

```python
l.append(1)

l.append(2)

assert len(l) == 2

```
And thats all for now, and we saw how awesome thing we can do

```python
```
